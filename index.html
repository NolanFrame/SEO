<h1>Define Love</h1>

<p style="font-family:courier;">First-year writing Assignment</p>



<p style="color:black;"> Love? Nobody knows the real and true definition of love, as it seems to have endless  definitions attached to it. If you ask the internet what love is then you will receive a very standard definition, black and white as some would call it, but there is a grey area that the internet, nor a computer could manage to ‘feel’. Love is something that cannot just be summarized, it has to be felt, seen and acted out to understand its different qualities. 
</p>

<p style="color:black;"> If you were to search the definition of love you will find ‘affection’ very closely attached to it. We show affection to the people we love in different ways, like always being there during a tough time, cuddling up next to your dog or even a mother hugging her child. I recently went through a tough time, my dad was diagnosed with cancer, but my closest friend Brett was there for me during that time and I didnt feel alone with the issue. That is love.

<p style="color:black;"> I found that love is to care, everyone cares about their family and their pets, caring is what reinforces and rehabilitates. If you see someone having a tough day, you ask them what you can do to help, that is caring. Or you come across your child who has fallen off their bike so you clean them up, that is caring. These actions of caring for one another all relate back to one word and it is love.

  <p style="color:black;"> There is no standard definition of love but there are many forms of it. I found that there are seven characteristics. Physical, playful, friendship, maternal, long lasting, and self love (vikasayoga.com). These different characteristics come together forming the strongest version of the word love and it is what makes it special in my opinion. Love is a universal feeling that can be shared throughout cultures, races, families, friends and so on, love is endless.

<p style="color:black;"> Love is many things, but it is not hatred. Love is to bring someone up, not pull them down, it is to help not hurt, work with not abandon. To love someone is to accept them for everything that they are. You can not live a life of hatred towards others as you will soon start to hate yourself from within, love is the answer to success and wealth, it is the answer to life.

<p  style="color:black;"> A short story with no author I found revolving around love is called Love, Wealth, and Success. This story explains how three white bearded men stood outside a family's house, the family is told to choose one as they can only have one to come inside. The family pondered on which to invite when the daughter spoke up and said love, so the parents agreed. As love was invited in, the rest followed. The family was confused and asked about their rule to which Success and Wealth stated "If you had invited Wealth or Success, the other two of us would've stayed out, but since you invited Love, wherever He goes, we go with him. Wherever there is Love, there is also Wealth and Success!" The short story shows the significance of love and how it is the centerpiece of our lives. Although you may have a different definition of the word it is a very special word that holds a place in everyone's life, from the love of your family to the love of your favorite basketball. It is universal. There is no true definition as nobody knows the actual meaning and roots of the word. It is the grey area.
